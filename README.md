## Anomaly detection: A survey [1]
Anomaly detection is a widely researched area, there has been research on it across multiple application domains. This paper attempts to provide a detailed and understandable overview of the research on anomaly detection. Unlike other surveys this survey covers a wide range of techniques and applications, “Anomaly detection finds extensive use in a wide variety of applications such as fraud detection for credit cards, insurance, or health care, intrusion detection for cyber-security, fault detection in safety critical systems, and military surveillance for enemy activities”. Anomaly detection is important because anomalous data often means something is wrong, for example in cyber-security an anomaly often means some sort of malicious activity is happening. Intrusion detection is the detection of these malicious activities (intrusions), an intrusion is different from the systems usual behaviour, hence why anomaly detection techniques are used. The paper identifies some challenges of anomaly detection in intrusion detection such as, the huge volume of data, data typically comes in a streaming fashion, and because of the large sized input there can be a lot of false alarms.  In network intrusion detection the intrusions usually occur as anomalous patterns, so techniques have been developed to detect not just single anomalies but anomalous sequences (collective anomalies).  

## Deep Learning in Intrusion Detection Perspective: Overview and Further Challenges [2]
This paper looks into how deep learning can be used in intrusion detection. In the Anomaly detection survey paper they said that a challenge of anomaly detection in intrusion detection is the huge volume of data, with deep learning this isn’t much of a challenge since deep learning techniques are known to cope with large-scale data. This paper looks at 3 different detection types for intrusion detection: misuse, anomaly, and specification-based. Anomaly-based detection has the lowest detection rate and highest false alarm rate of the 3 techniques; however, it is the only technique that is capable of unknown attack detection. This is because the other methods use known attack patterns or violation of pre-defined rules to detect intrusions.
There are two main deep learning types, supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning requires datasets to be labeled with pre-defined classes, whereas, unsupervised learning doesn’t need a labeled dataset for training. There is also hybrid deep learning which combines supervised and unsupervised learning. This paper concluded that “Deep learning have significantly improved Intrusion Detection Systems”.  A further challenge of theirs was to build an intrusion detection system that can detect unknown attacks with high detection rate and low false alarm rate. 

## Intrusion detection system for signal based SIP attacks through timed HCPN [3]
This paper discusses the vulnerability of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is now a widely used protocol for creating sessions for multiple participants, for example an internet telephone call. The paper explains how SIP is vulnerable to signal based attacks due to it’s signalling feature. As SIP has security problems, an intrusion detection system is proposed which uses both misuse and anomaly detection. Although SIP is susceptible to various different attacks like denial of service, eavesdropping, and hijacking, the paper focuses on signal based attacks as they are the most common for SIP. Throughout the paper they demonstrate attacks and solutions for those attacks, as well as presenting a design for an intrusion detection system for SIP attacks. The paper only presented a design and not an actual intrusion detection system so there is no concrete evidence that it would work in the real world. However they say it will developed for practical use in the future. They concluded that SIP technology is at an early stage so the security will continue to improve greatly, but the attacks will not stop.
